### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Research Masters student at HKUST in the beautiful and bustling Hong Kong. I did my undergraduate studies in Electronics & Computer Engineering at HKUST also. My research involved imaging, hardware configuration, machine learning, statistical signal processing and optimization.

Most of the time, I enjoy programming, doing research, writing, testing and modifying code as requested by my research advisors.

In any spare time I have, I love playing tennis and watching films.
